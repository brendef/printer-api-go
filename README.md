## FAQ

#### Why does this not work over SSL/HTTPS

I just need to install an SSL Certificate and configure nginx or apache then it should be good to go.

#### Why GoLang

It is an amazing language that is super easy to build and run as a server on a Linux machine.

#### Why AWS EC2

My goal was to get something up and running ASAP. EC2s are super simple make a perfect dev environmnet. I do belive a serverless product such as *Amplify* for the front end and *lambda* would have been better. I will migrate this later one to use these technologies for sure!
